Lehan Zhang
Undergraduate Junior | Beijing Institute of Fashion Technology
Major: Information Management and Information Systems

I am currently a third-year undergraduate student majoring in Information Management and Information Systems at Beijing Institute of Fashion Technology. My research interests include multimodal AI, general artificial intelligence, diffusion learning, and AI for Science (AI4S). I plan to pursue a master's degree at the School of Software and Microelectronics at Peking University, where I aim to deepen my understanding of these cutting-edge technologies.

I have already made strides in my academic journey, with a paper presented at the 9th International Conference on Signal Processing (ICSP). Additional research contributions are underway, and I look forward to advancing my expertise in the field of artificial intelligence.
